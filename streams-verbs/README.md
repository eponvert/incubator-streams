streams-verbs
=================

An "Object Combination" a description of what types of actor, object
and target objects are typically expected to be used with a
particular verb.

streams-verbs performs registration and enforcement of activity 
stream verb definitions, restricting the type of activities deemed
valid across the stream or upon application of a filtering component.

A recommended baseline set of verb definitions are available and can be
activated by including streams-verbs resources on your classpath.
